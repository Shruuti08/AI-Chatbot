# AI-Chatbot-with-NLP
This project focuses on building a basic yet effective AI chatbot using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. It highlights how computers can mimic human conversation through rule-based pattern matching, reflection mechanisms, and simple text preprocessing. The chatbot can respond to common user questions and serves as a strong introductory project for understanding the fundamentals of NLP and conversational AI development.

# Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to build an AI-powered chatbot that can:
- Engage in text-based conversations.
- Recognize specific user inputs using regular expressions.
- Respond contextually with pre-defined answers.
- Exit the conversation gracefully when prompted.
This project is perfect for beginners in NLP, Python learners, or anyone interested in exploring the basics of chatbot development.

# Technologies Used
- Python 3.x – Core programming language.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – A powerful library for NLP operations and pattern-based conversations.
- Regex (Regular Expressions) – To match user inputs with appropriate chatbot responses.

# Features
- Responds to greetings like "hi", "hello", "hey".
- Answers questions about itself and NLP.
- Recognizes queries using pattern matching.
- Uses reflections to make replies more natural (e.g., "I am" → "you are").
- Gracefully exits when the user types "bye", "exit", or "quit".
- Handles unrecognized inputs with fallback responses.
- Fully commented code to help understand the flow and logic.
